🧾 Fix: Chat Form Language, Layout, and User Identity Handling
🧩 1. Language Isolation in Form Tabs
🛠 Issue:
Both the English and Svenska tabs show a mix of English and Swedish text—including placeholders, dropdown options, and button labels.

✅ Task:
Ensure each tab displays only content in its corresponding language:

Labels, placeholders, dropdowns, and buttons.

Validate that switching tabs completely refreshes the language without caching mixed content.

🛡️ Safeguard:
Keep dropdown logic intact—do not refactor dropdown structure unless required.

Avoid affecting the submission behavior or validation already in place.

🧱 2. Fix Layout Gaps Between Form Fields
🛠 Issue:
There are excessive vertical gaps between form fields, causing visual imbalance.

✅ Task:
Adjust spacing (likely margins/paddings) between:

Input fields

Dropdown

Submit button

Follow consistent spacing values from the design system (e.g., Tailwind: mb-4 or gap-3)

🛡️ Safeguard:
Apply layout fixes within form component scope only.

Do not alter global form/input styling shared with other modules.

👤 3. User Identity & Record Update Logic
🛠 Issue:
All users currently appear as Anonymous User in Recent Conversations—even after filling out the form.

✅ Task:
On successful form submission, update the Recent Conversations record:

Replace Anonymous User with:

Full name (from form)

Restaurant name (if available)

This update should reflect in:

Recent Conversations Panel

Conversation Preview

Chat thread view header (if present)

🛡️ Safeguard:
Only perform identity update if form was submitted completely and validly.

Ensure fallback to Anonymous User still works if form is skipped.

📈 4. Lead Tracking Integration
✅ Task:
After form submission:

Log the user’s info into User Leads

Link the lead to the corresponding Recent Conversation record

🛡️ Safeguard:
Do not overwrite existing lead data if user has submitted before (match on email or phone).

Ensure the form submission does not break current chat flow or real-time messaging.

🎯 Summary of Required Outcomes
 Each tab displays only its own language (complete translation scope)

 Dropdown and buttons match tab language

 Spacing between inputs is visually balanced and clean

 “Anonymous User” is updated with name + restaurant after form submission

 Submitted user info is stored in:

User Leads

Recent Conversations

 No regression in dropdown behavior or chat handling

 All updates are isolated to form component and chat UI logic only
