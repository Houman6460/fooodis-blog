The User Registration Form - First Form in Fooodis Chatbot
What is the First Form?
The User Registration Form is the first interactive form that users encounter in the Fooodis Chatbot system. It's designed to collect user information before allowing full access to the chatbot conversation.

When Does the Registration Form Open?
Trigger Conditions
The registration form opens automatically in several scenarios:

New User Detection - When the system detects a first-time visitor with no previous conversation history
After Welcome Message - Following the initial bilingual welcome greeting
Before Agent Handoff - The system requires user information before connecting to specialized agents
Session Restart - When a user returns after their session expired
Specific Timing
Immediately after welcome: The form appears 2-3 seconds after the initial greeting message
Before full conversation: Users cannot access the complete chatbot features without registration
Optional but encouraged: Users can skip registration, but with limited functionality
